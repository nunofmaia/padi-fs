\section{Changes}

After reading the reviews and taking a hard look to the ideas for the system and
their implementations, we realized that some flaws were present. Some of the
ideas were not very well thought and some things were not even in the paper
but, as we were developing the system, made sense that we should implement
them.

The biggest changes made to the implementation of PADI-FS were the migration
algorithm, the versioning of files and the synchronization and recovering of
metadata servers.
