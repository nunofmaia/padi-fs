\subsection{Metadata Server}

Metadata servers maintain metadata information about the files stored
in the data servers. This metadata holds relevant information about
the files such as the file name, the number of servers used to store
the contents of the file, the minimum number of data servers that should
be contacted during the read and write operations and a list of the
data servers that have the file stored. This servers also keep track of
other replicas that may exist, which data servers are available or not as
well as the number of files each one of them holds, the clients that can
interact with the system and which files they have open and files that have
to be updated because there are not enough data servers to answer to its
requests. The reason why we keep knowledge of this things and more
will be explained below on document.

\subsubsection{Replication}

As it was previously mentioned, there are 3 replicas of the metadata
server. The purpose of these replicas is to have the content of the
server replicated so that when a replica fails, there's another one
that can reply to the requests made. This replication is made in a
passive manner, which means that just one of the replicas will be
responsible for all the operations. Passive replication
is more useful in this system than active replication in a way that we
can tolerate two failures and have always a server to be able to reply to
any request made by the client. At any moment in time, the primary replica
can fail and another one has to replace it but for this to happen without
any problems, the replicas need to be synchronized. The primary replica is
responsible for sending some kind of instruction to the other replicas for
them to have the same state as the primary. To accomplish this, each replica
logs the command issued by the primary one and behaves accordingly. As we
go further in this paper, we'll explain how the log plays an important goal
when a server recovers.

\subsubsection{Handling Files}

The primary server can reply to several requests from the client. This
request are create, open, close and delete operations.

\medskip
\textbf{Create}
\smallskip 

When a client sends a request to create a file, the server saves a new
registry for that file with the information sent with the request. The
server informs the available data servers needed with the least amount
of saved files to save a local copy of the file, updates the load
of each data server tha will hold that file and sends the file's metadata
to the client. When the client requests for the file to be replicated in
a certain number of data servers is greater than the data servers that 
exist at that moment, the metadata server sends the file's metadata to 
the client with the data servers available and puts the file on a pending 
lists so that when a new data server register, the metadata of the file 
can be updated and sent back to the client. The file stays in the pending 
list until all the data servers request are available.

%The
%primary replica must inform the necessary data servers that they need to
%create a local copy of the file and wait for them to reply back. Then
%it increases the number of files for each server and sends the new 
%entry to the other two replicas so they can be up to date. It's important 
%to mention that when a data server is down, the metadata server will try 
%to send the request to another server. If there are no more servers to 
%send the request to, the metadata server will wait for the data server 
%to come up to send it the information it needs to create the file. A 
%secondary replica can also be down when the primary one sends its new 
%information. When this happens, the primary server will not wait for 
%the reply of the other server. Just after this exchange of requests and
%replies, the metadata server tells the client it's all good and the file 
%was successfully created.

\medskip
\textbf{Open}
\smallskip

After creating a file, the client can operate on it right away. But when
the file is closed, the client can request to open it. In this case, the
metadta server sends to the client the metadata stored for that file. The
server keeps record of what clients opened a certain file, so when a client
opens a file, the metadata server adds it to the list of the corresponding
file.

%After creating a file, the client can open it. In this case, the metadata 
%server sends the client all the information it has stored for that file.
%The metadata server has a counter per file to know how many users have 
%that file opened. While the file is open, it cannot be copied if the data 
%server that holds the file is not available.

When a client asks to delete a file, the metadata server decreases the
number of files for each server that holds the file and removes the 
corresponding entry from the table where all the information is stored. 
All this changes are also sent to the secondary metadata servers. 
The system does not provide any functionality to clean the garbage that 
the data servers keep stored.

The primary metadata, from time to time, pings the data servers to know 
which are available and which are not. When a data server is not 
available, the metadata server will try to migrate the files stored on 
that server to another one. The new server should be on the available 
can't already have stored the file that needs to be copied. The 
copy of the files should happen only if the file being copied isn't open. When 
the file is fully copied to other server, meaning the metadata already sent 
the request to an available server that has the file stored to copy it to the new 
server and did receive the response saying the file was copied, the metadata 
server has to update the list of servers that hold that file. The downside 
of this process is that the file is no longer referenced to the old server 
but the file is still there and there's is not a proper way to remove it.

\subsubsection{Failure and Recovery}

All the replicas need to know if the primary replica is well and good to 
keep executing the requests that clients are making. To keep track of this, 
the primary server sends a heartbeat along with a log of the servers that 
are available and unavailable so they can update their own list. Supposing 
the primary replica is down and can't send the other replicas the heartbeat 
they're expecting, the replicas need to cover the primary so the client can 
keep asking for create, open or close operations. To do this, the replicas 
send each other their ID's and the one with the lower ID is the new primary
replica. If a replica does not receive any response from the other, it 
means that it is not available either and this replica has no choice but to 
be the new primary server. When a replica recovers, asks the others who is 
the primary server and updates its state accordingly. During all this process, 
metadata servers can't respond to any request from the clients.
