\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a solution for PADI-FS, a distributed system 
to manage set of files.

We have revised our knowledge base of distributed systems, looked for solutions 
already applied to existent systems and tried to implement them along with some 
of our own solutions and ideas taking into consideration the feedback given
by collegues and professors. The proposed solution for the system tries to 
solve problems of consistency and concurrency and tolerate failures of different 
servers.
