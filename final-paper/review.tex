\section{Review}

The first version of this paper was reviewed by the professors and other groups
to evaluate the ideas we had for the system and how those same ideas could be
implemented. After reading the reviews that were sent to us, there were some
doubts about certain topics addressed in the paper:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Timestamps and sequence number
\item Read and write operations

\end{enumerate}

Among the enumerated problems addressed to us, there were also some complaints
about the structure and technicality of our paper.

In the next section, we talk about the changes made to our implementation while
developing the system and taking into account all the advices and critics.
