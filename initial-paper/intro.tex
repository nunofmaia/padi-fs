\section{Introduction}

Computers use a file system to store, retrieve and update files. The file
system provides an interface to manage the organization and the access of
the data stored in it.

A distributed file system extends the regular file system allowing the
access to files from multiple machines. This kind of system makes possible
for a large number of users on their own machines to access the same files.

There are lots of implementations of distributed systems, such as AFS 
(Andrew File System), Google File System and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File 
System). With the implementation of PADI-FS, we aim to do something very
similar but a lot simpler.
